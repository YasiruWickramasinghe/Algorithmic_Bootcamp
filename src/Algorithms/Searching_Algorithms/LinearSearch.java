    //Description:
        //Linear search is a simple searching algorithm that iterates through each element in a list sequentially until a match is found or the end of the list is reached.

    //Steps:
        //Start from the beginning of the list.
        //Compare the target element with the current element.
        //If a match is found, return the index of the element.
        //If the end of the list is reached without finding a match, indicate that the element is not present.
